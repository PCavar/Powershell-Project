# HyperV-Project
Easy and simple way to Provision Domain Controllers and Virtual Machines

My first project in PowerShell.
This script has a Menu for Provisioning Domain Controllers/AD and Virtual Machines.
You can Provision, remove, start,turnoff and install some AD/DS features. 
You can always add and configure it how you like but I find the baseline neat.

Requirements for this to work without and hassle is a SysPrep WS2012-2022/WindowsPro for VMs.
Recommended to use Powershell Core 7.3.0 and higher.
NOTE: As you are managing Hyper-V with provisioning, elevated accessrights(admin) are required.

Have fun!
